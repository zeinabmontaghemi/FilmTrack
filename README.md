# Overview

On this website, you can search for a movie using the search bar. Movie information is fetched from the OMDB API and displayed as you type. Once you select the desired movie, you can rate it, and it will be added to your list of watched movies.

This project is built using React, leveraging useEffect for data fetching and custom hooks.
